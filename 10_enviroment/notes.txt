if we go the company these are the procedures,,

QA->Quality Assurance;
UAT->User Acceptance Testing
PRODUCTION(final code publish in the real time server);

whatever the code we going to write there will some stages are 

like below 

QA->UAT->PRODUCTION
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Enviroment variables

any constant variables that we using like port:8088, we are store in one common place,
to set up some Enviroment variables we have to create a file .env
->PORT=8088;
cmd-> npm install dotenv
index.js->
const dotenv = require('dotenv');
dotenv.config();
->process.env.PORT

when we want to Enviroment variables?
- any constant value such as PORT number,url,hardcoded string
- mainly used to change data in different enviroment

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Enviroment variable revision

->using enviroment variable we can configure our application constants outside of our codebase
->.env is a separate file
-> in that separate file any configuration of constant variable like portnumber,database name,password everything we can keep in the separate file

-> it provides the information about the enviroment in which process is running
->It handles senstive data like db username,db password, payment keys   


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
route parameter or params;

http://locahost:8088/product/22
//22 is the route parameter or params
// passing dynamic value in the url is called dynamic API or dynami RESTAPI;

Query params
http://locahost:8088/product?search="name":"lg"&"price"="200"
-> these are the optional params
