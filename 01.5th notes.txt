how node js works ?

* Node js is not working on single thread 
* Any incoming request first it will go inside event queue 
* event loop will take one request from event queue
* event loop will process non - blocking operation and send back the result 
* In event loop for blocking operation separate theread will be created from the thread pool


Event driven->

* A call back function is called when an event triggers 
* A event loop that listens for event triggers and calls the corresponding event handler for that events
* These events are accessed via 'event' module
* It consists of the event listener and an event emitter;


API

Application Programming Interface 

* It is a set of commands, functions or protocol that act as intermeadiary b/w two applications

REST API;

Representations state transfer 
*It means the trasfer of the state via http
*format such as json,html,xml ,plain text;
*Rest will work only on http protocol;
*http methods get,post,patch;



MERN->

MangoDB,Express Js,React Js, Node.js

the react and others are the front end libraries using these it is easy to build UI;

In the frame work and library most of the time we use packages	

Nodes js is not a language -> 

*To run the javascript outside the browser and node js will help to setup backend

* Set up means they have inbuild modules like file system (default) , http module, by using the node we write the back end code

Express js
(it will help to develop the rest api)

* First of all the express js is a frame work for node js 
* It is easy to build 
* It supports routing
* It supports view rendering(it can able to render the front end code also,html,css,js together we can write it and we can render from the backend);
* It supports middleware  (tunnel requests)  (any code that is in the backend multiple validation will happen ,middleware means a set of validation , if everything is proper than only you can receive the data)

First express js project setup---->

* For any js projects we need package.json
* To create package.json
-> npm init
-> npm install express
->after we have to create index.js and app.js
-> the starting file will always be index.js so we add "start":"node index"

->inside the index.js put console.log("express ");
-> After that inside the app.js we have to import the particular package require('express') const express = require("express");
-> after that we have to execute that function  const app = express() (then only all the return data it will store) inside the app;

Simple get method we are going to write now->

app.get('',(req,res)=>{
	res.send("<h1>hello world</h1>")
})
->It consists of two parameter   
1.one is empty string
2.callback function() it consists of the request and reponse 
 
response means sending the data to the front end 

After that we have to export that variable module.export = app;


->After exporting the app we have to import inside the app.js file

const app = require("./app")

app.listen(8080,()=>{
console.log("server is listening on port 8080")
})



--------------------------------------------------------------------------
-> without data base proper structure and proper code we have to write
-> currently we can use fileSystem(means storing data directly inside the file);
-> struct format we use always json format;
->if we use data base also , it going to store the file in the form of json
-> using data from the data base is faster than reading the file(fileSystem)
->if we read the file from data base it will be faster;

// first we have write the code one rest api using get method
