Here's a clearer explanation of your content with some corrections and simplifications:

---

**What is Mongoose?**

Mongoose is an **ODM (Object Data Modeling) library** for MongoDB and Node.js.  
It acts as a bridge between your Node.js application and the MongoDB database.

---

**How does it work?**

- **Node.js -> Mongoose -> MongoDB**  
  Your Node.js application doesn't directly connect to MongoDB. Instead, it connects to Mongoose, which manages the interaction with MongoDB.  

---

**Why use Mongoose?**

Without Mongoose:  
- There’s no schema enforcement. This means MongoDB will accept any type of data, which can lead to inconsistencies and validation issues.  

With Mongoose, you get the following benefits:  
1. **Schema Definition**: Define a structure (schema) for your data.  
2. **Validations**: Ensure the data follows specific rules before being saved.  
3. **Proper Data Types**: Control the type of data stored in the database.  
4. **Helper Methods**: Use built-in methods to simplify CRUD operations (e.g., save, find, update).  
5. **Promises**: All methods in Mongoose return a promise, so you can use `.then()` and `.catch()` for asynchronous operations.

**Schema in Mongoose**

A **schema** is a blueprint that defines the structure of documents in a MongoDB collection.  
For example:  
- What fields the document should have (e.g., `name`, `age`, `email`)  
- The type of each field (e.g., `String`, `Number`)  
- Any additional rules (e.g., required fields, default values)

With Mongoose, you can ensure:  
1. Data matches the schema before being sent to the database.  
2. Data is validated and cleaned, reducing the risk of errors.  
3. The database behaves more like SQL with a strict pattern.

---

**How does this make MongoDB behave like SQL?**  
While MongoDB is a NoSQL database (schema-less by default), using Mongoose makes it feel more structured.  
- You can enforce rules (like SQL schemas).  
- If the data matches the schema, it’s saved to the database. Otherwise, it’s rejected.  

In simple terms, Mongoose helps you organize and validate your data, making it easier to maintain and work with MongoDB.

Mongoose;

What is Mongoose?
It is ODM - Object Data Module


Nodejs -> Mongoose -> Monogodb
* Means from the node we are not directly connecting to Monogodb, firt node connect with mongoose and it will connect with mongodb

Reason?
No mongoose means there no schema, if there is no schema means it will allow any type of data without validation and will get some many issues

Benifit->
1.We can provide schema
2.Validations 
3.Proper data type and values
4.We have lot of helper methods similar to mongodb
5.All methods in mongoose will return a promise(when ever it is going to return a promise how we can access the result means using .then() and .catch() block);

schema->
* It is a pre-defined pattern inside the collection what type of data should be inserted  
* Using mongoose we are telling if we have these particular property then only you send to database(mongodb) otherwise don't send
*Main purpose of mongoose is for schema creation 
* This will make similar to SQL(measn strick pattern it will follow, if it is matches then it will send to mongodb)
*Using Monogodb we can work like a SQL also
